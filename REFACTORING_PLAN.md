```sql
ALTER TABLE digital_products 
ADD COLUMN platform_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES platforms(id),
ADD COLUMN platform_buying_price DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
```

#### 2. Stock Sales Table Updates
```sql
ALTER TABLE stock_sales 
ADD COLUMN platform_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES platforms(id),

## üìä Data Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Schema Preparation
1. Create new tables (platforms, platform_credit_movements)
2. Add new columns to existing tables
3. Create indexes for performance optimization

### Phase 2: Data Migration
1. Create default platform for existing products
2. Associate all existing products with default platform
3. Set initial buying prices based on historical data
4. Update sales records with platform associations
5. Calculate historical profit data where possible

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Remove purchase-related tables and data
2. Clean up unused columns and indexes
3. Update foreign key constraints

### Migration Scripts
- `001_create_platforms_table.sql`
- `002_create_credit_movements_table.sql`
- `003_modify_products_table.sql`
- `004_modify_sales_table.sql`
- `005_migrate_existing_data.sql`
- `006_cleanup_purchase_data.sql`
