# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Deployment and Monitoring Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a plan for deploying the refactored system and monitoring its performance post-deployment.
# Details:
Create a deployment strategy that includes:
- Database migration sequence
- Code deployment process
- Rollback procedures
- Downtime minimization techniques
- Post-deployment verification steps

Implement monitoring for:
- Application performance
- Database query performance
- API response times
- Error rates and exceptions
- User activity patterns

Use a blue-green deployment approach to minimize downtime. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout. Use monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or ELK stack. Create alerts for critical issues. Plan for 48-72 hours of enhanced monitoring post-deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment procedures in a staging environment. Verify that monitoring tools capture relevant metrics. Test rollback procedures. Simulate failure scenarios to verify alerting. Create a deployment checklist with verification steps.
