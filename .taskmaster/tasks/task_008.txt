# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Credit Management API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop API endpoints for platform credit operations and balance management.
# Details:
Implement the following API endpoints:
- POST /api/platforms/:id/credits - Add credits
- POST /api/platforms/:id/credits/deduct - Deduct credits
- GET /api/platforms/:id/credits/balance - Get current balance
- GET /api/platforms/:id/credits/movements - Get credit movement history

Implement proper request validation. Ensure atomic operations with transaction support. Add appropriate error handling for cases like insufficient funds. Include filtering and pagination for movement history. Document API using OpenAPI/Swagger.

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests for each endpoint. Test success and failure scenarios. Verify transaction integrity during errors. Test concurrent requests to ensure thread safety. Verify audit trail entries are created correctly.
