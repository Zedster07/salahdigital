# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Low Balance Alert System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a notification system to alert users when platform credit balances fall below defined thresholds.
# Details:
Implement an alert system with:
- Configurable threshold per platform
- In-app notifications
- Email alerts to administrators
- Daily summary of low-balance platforms

Use a notification service pattern. Implement a scheduled job to check balances periodically. Create a notification queue for reliability. Use a templating system for notification messages. Consider implementing webhooks for external integrations.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for alert threshold logic. Test notification generation for various scenarios. Verify email sending functionality. Test scheduled jobs. Create integration tests for the complete alert flow. Test with various threshold configurations.
