# Title: Update Product API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify existing product API endpoints to include platform association and platform-specific pricing.
# Details:
Update the following API endpoints:
- GET /api/products - Add platform filtering
- GET /api/products/:id - Include platform details
- POST /api/products - Require platform association
- PUT /api/products/:id - Support platform updates

Update request validation to include platform-related fields. Modify response structures to include platform information. Update documentation to reflect changes. Consider adding endpoints for platform-specific product operations if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Update API tests to verify platform-related functionality. Test platform filtering in list endpoints. Verify platform association validation. Test that platform details are correctly included in responses. Create integration tests for the complete product management flow.
