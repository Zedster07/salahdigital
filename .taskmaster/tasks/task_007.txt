# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Platform Management API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints for platform management operations (CRUD).
# Details:
Implement the following API endpoints:
- GET /api/platforms - List all platforms
- GET /api/platforms/:id - Get platform details
- POST /api/platforms - Create new platform
- PUT /api/platforms/:id - Update platform
- DELETE /api/platforms/:id - Delete platform (with safeguards)

Implement proper request validation using a library like Joi or express-validator. Add authentication and authorization middleware. Include pagination for list endpoints. Implement proper error handling and response formatting. Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests for each endpoint using a tool like Supertest or Jest. Test authentication and authorization scenarios. Verify validation works correctly for invalid inputs. Test pagination and filtering. Create integration tests that verify database changes.
