# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create Data Migration Scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop scripts to migrate existing data to the new platform-based model.
# Details:
Create migration scripts for:
- Creating a default platform for existing products
- Associating existing products with the default platform
- Setting initial buying prices based on available data
- Updating historical sales data with platform associations
- Calculating historical profit data where possible

Implement data validation before and after migration. Create rollback scripts for each migration step. Use database transactions to ensure atomicity. Add logging for all migration operations. Consider using a migration framework like Flyway or Liquibase.

# Test Strategy:
Test migration scripts on a copy of production data. Verify data integrity after migration. Test rollback procedures. Validate that all products have valid platform associations. Verify historical sales data is preserved. Test performance with large datasets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema for Default Platform [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the database schema to support the new platform-based model, including a default platform for existing products.
### Details:
Define tables and relationships for platforms, products, and their associations. Ensure the schema supports historical data and new platform-based structure.

## 2. Develop Script for Creating Default Platform [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Write a script to create a default platform in the new database structure.
### Details:
Include platform name, description, and any necessary metadata. Ensure the script is idempotent.

## 3. Create Product Association Script [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Develop a script to associate existing products with the default platform.
### Details:
Iterate through existing products and create associations with the default platform. Handle potential data inconsistencies.

## 4. Implement Buying Price Migration Script [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Write a script to set initial buying prices based on available data.
### Details:
Extract existing price data, transform as needed, and update the new schema. Handle missing or invalid data gracefully.

## 5. Develop Historical Sales Data Migration Script [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Create a script to update historical sales data with new platform associations.
### Details:
Modify existing sales records to include platform information. Ensure data integrity and consistency.

## 6. Implement Historical Profit Calculation Script [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4, 19.5
### Description: Develop a script to calculate and populate historical profit data where possible.
### Details:
Use available sales and buying price data to compute profits. Handle scenarios with incomplete data.

## 7. Create Data Validation Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6
### Description: Implement scripts for data validation before and after migration.
### Details:
Develop checks for data integrity, consistency, and completeness. Include validation for all migrated data types.

## 8. Develop Rollback Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6
### Description: Create rollback scripts for each migration step to ensure reversibility.
### Details:
Implement scripts to undo each migration step. Ensure data integrity is maintained during rollback.

## 9. Implement Transaction Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6
### Description: Integrate database transactions into migration scripts to ensure atomicity.
### Details:
Wrap each migration step in a database transaction. Handle commit and rollback scenarios.

## 10. Add Logging Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6, 19.7, 19.8, 19.9
### Description: Implement comprehensive logging for all migration operations.
### Details:
Add detailed logging to each script, including start/end times, affected records, and any errors encountered.
