# Description: Develop frontend components for platform management operations.

Create the following UI components:

Use a modern frontend framework like React with hooks or Vue.js 3 with Composition API. Implement form validation using a library like Formik or Vuelidate. Create reusable components for common elements. Implement proper error handling and loading states. Use a UI component library like Material-UI or Vuetify for consistent styling.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for UI components using Jest and React Testing Library or Vue Test Utils. Create snapshot tests for component rendering. Test form validation logic. Test error handling and loading states. Create integration tests for complete user flows.
