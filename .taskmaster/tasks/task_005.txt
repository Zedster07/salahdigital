# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Platform Model and Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the business logic layer for Platform entity management with proper validation and business rules.
# Details:
Create a Platform model class with:
- Properties matching the database schema
- Validation rules for all fields
- Methods for credit operations (addCredits, deductCredits)
- Low balance detection logic

Implement a Platform repository with:
- CRUD operations
- Credit management methods
- Query methods for reporting

Use a repository pattern for data access abstraction. Implement proper error handling and transaction management. Consider using a service layer for complex business logic. Use dependency injection for better testability.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for all model methods and validations. Create integration tests for repository methods. Test credit operations with various scenarios including edge cases. Mock dependencies for unit testing. Test low balance alert functionality.
