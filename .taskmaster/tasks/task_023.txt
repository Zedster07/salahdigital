# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive testing plan to validate the refactored system.
# Details:
Create a testing plan that includes:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for key workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical business processes
- Performance testing for database operations
- UI testing for all interfaces

Use a combination of automated and manual testing. Create test data that covers various business scenarios. Document test cases and expected results. Use a CI/CD pipeline for automated test execution. Consider using tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing.
