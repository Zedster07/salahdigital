# Digital Subscription Management System Refactoring PRD

## Project Overview
Refactor the existing digital subscription management system to align with the actual business model of platform-based digital product reselling.

## Current State Analysis
The system currently uses a traditional inventory model with stock purchases and sales. The business actually operates by:
- Subscribing to digital platforms (suppliers)
- Depositing credits into these platforms
- Purchasing products using platform credits
- Reselling products to clients with profit margins

## Business Requirements

### 1. Platform Management System
- Create new Platform entity to represent supplier platforms
- Track platform details: name, description, contact information
- Manage credit balances for each platform
- Support credit addition and deduction operations
- Monitor platform credit levels with low balance alerts

### 2. Product-Platform Integration
- Associate each digital product with a specific platform
- Track buying prices per platform for products
- Maintain product catalog with platform-specific pricing
- Support multiple products per platform

### 3. Enhanced Sales Process
- Redesign sales workflow to include platform selection
- Capture buying price from platform and selling price to client
- Support payment types: one-time and recurring subscriptions
- Handle recurring payment durations (1-12 months, custom periods)
- Automatic profit calculation (selling price - buying price)

### 4. Credit Management System
- Automatic credit deduction from platforms when sales are completed
- Create audit trail for all platform credit movements
- Real-time credit balance updates
- Credit movement history and reporting

### 5. Financial Tracking & Reporting
- Track profit per sale with platform cost basis
- Monitor platform credit utilization
- Generate platform profitability reports
- Alert system for low platform credits
- Financial dashboard with key metrics

### 6. Legacy System Migration
- Remove "Achats" (Purchases) feature completely
- Migrate existing data to new platform-based model
- Maintain data integrity during transition
- Preserve historical sales data with platform associations

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Changes
- Add platforms table with credit management
- Modify digital_products table to include platform_id
- Update stock_sales table for platform integration
- Add platform_credit_movements table for audit trail
- Remove stock_purchases related tables and references

### API Endpoint Updates
- Create platform management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- Add credit management endpoints (add/deduct credits)
- Update product endpoints for platform association
- Modify sales endpoints for new workflow
- Remove purchase-related endpoints

### Frontend Component Changes
- Create Platform management interface
- Update Product forms for platform selection
- Redesign Sales forms for new workflow
- Remove Purchase-related components
- Add credit management interface
- Update dashboard for platform metrics

### Data Migration Strategy
- Create migration scripts for existing data
- Map current products to default platforms
- Preserve historical sales data
- Clean up purchase-related data
- Validate data integrity post-migration

## Success Criteria
- All existing sales data preserved and accessible
- New platform-based workflow fully functional
- Credit management system operational
- Financial reporting accurate and comprehensive
- System performance maintained or improved
- Zero data loss during migration

## Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive backup before migration
- Staged rollout with rollback capability
- Extensive testing of new workflows
- User training on new interface
- Monitoring system for post-deployment issues

## Timeline Considerations
- Database schema changes require careful planning
- Frontend updates need user experience testing
- Data migration requires validation checkpoints
- Deployment should be done during low-usage periods
- Post-deployment monitoring for 48-72 hours
