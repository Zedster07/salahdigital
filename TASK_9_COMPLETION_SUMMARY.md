- ✅ **Automatic Calculations**: Auto-calculates selling price from buying price + margin

### ✅ API Layer Enhancements

#### 1. New RESTful Endpoints
**File**: `netlify/functions/api.js`

- ✅ **`GET /api/platforms/:id/products`**: Get products for specific platform
- ✅ **`POST /api/product-pricing-calculate`**: Calculate pricing based on margin
- ✅ **`PUT /api/product-platform-association`**: Update product-platform links

#### 2. Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- ✅ **Product Creation**: Now supports platform fields
- ✅ **Product Updates**: Handles platform pricing updates
- ✅ **Product Retrieval**: Includes platform metadata

### ✅ Frontend Integration

#### 1. Updated ProductForm Component
**File**: `src/components/Inventory/ProductForm.tsx`

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Platform Selection**: Dropdown for choosing supplier platform
- ✅ **Dynamic Pricing**: Auto-calculation based on platform buying price + margin
- ✅ **Conditional Fields**: Different pricing fields based on platform selection
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Price updates as user changes buying price or margin
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced margin display with platform cost breakdown

**Form Enhancements:**
- ✅ **Platform Association**: Select from active platforms with balance display
- ✅ **Platform Buying Price**: Required when platform is selected
- ✅ **Profit Margin**: Percentage-based margin calculation
- ✅ **Calculated Selling Price**: Auto-calculated and editable
- ✅ **Legacy Support**: Falls back to traditional pricing when no platform selected

#### 2. Updated API Utility
**File**: `src/utils/api.ts`

**New Methods:**
- ✅ **`getProductsByPlatform(platformId)`**: Frontend method for platform-specific products
- ✅ **`calculateProductPricing(buyingPrice, margin)`**: Frontend pricing calculations
- ✅ **`updateProductPlatformAssociation(productId, platformId)`**: Platform association management

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- ✅ **JOIN Queries**: Efficient platform data retrieval with product queries
- ✅ **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations for data consistency

### Pricing Logic
- ✅ **Automatic Calculation**: `sellingPrice = buyingPrice * (1 + margin/100)`
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Frontend auto-calculation on input changes
- ✅ **Validation**: Ensures positive values and reasonable margins
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Manual override capability for calculated prices

### Platform Validation
- ✅ **Existence Check**: Validates platform exists before association
- ✅ **Active Status**: Only allows association with active platforms
- ✅ **Credit Balance**: Displays platform balance for informed decisions
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance Features

### Input Validation
- ✅ **Platform Association**: Validates platform exists and is active
