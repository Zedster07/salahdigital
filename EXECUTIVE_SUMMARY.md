# 📊 Executive Summary: Digital Subscription Management System Refactoring

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Objective:** Transform your digital subscription management system from a traditional inventory model to a platform-based credit management system that accurately reflects your business operations.

**Current Challenge:** The system uses "Achats" (Purchases) which doesn't align with your actual business model of depositing credits into supplier platforms and reselling digital products.

**Solution:** Comprehensive refactoring to implement platform management, credit tracking, and automated financial operations.

## 🔄 Business Model Transformation

### From Traditional Inventory → To Platform-Based Credits

| Current System | New System |
|----------------|------------|
| Stock purchases from suppliers | Credit deposits to platforms |
| Manual inventory tracking | Automatic credit deduction |
| Basic profit calculation | Real-time profit tracking |
| Limited financial insights | Comprehensive platform analytics |
